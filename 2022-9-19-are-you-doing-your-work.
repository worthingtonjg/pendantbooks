title:  Are You Doing Your Work?
---
I have been thinking a lot lately about what our “real” work is. Do you know what yours is? It’s not necessarily your job. In fact, your job might be the thing you have chosen to do to distract yourself from focusing on your real work.

Now do not misunderstand me, I’m not one of those who is going to tell you to chuck everything you have accomplished in your life and go live out your dream to be a painter. Quite the opposite.

I have always believed my work to be writing, as it’s the one thing I always come back to when the storms and upheavals of life finish tossing me end-over-end and settle back down. Writing fulfills me in way that few other things do. But my mother-in-law died of ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease) in our home. This insidious disease strips its victims of all ability to move or even communicate, while leaving their perfectly healthy minds unaffected to fully comprehend that they have become prisoners in their bodies. This horrible illness did, however, grant one tender mercy. It took her slowly enough that all of her children were able to be at her bedside when she passed. 

As I am well into middle-age now and can see the end of my life much clearer than ever before, I can tell you this: Writing may indeed be my work, but when I’m on my deathbed, how many books I wrote, or how successful I was as an author, will matter little to me when compared to having my loved ones gathered around me. They are the legacy that will matter to me far more than whether someone is still reading my books in a hundred years.

Granting that there are more important things in life than “my work”, however, does not mean that we will not be happier and more fulfilled by pursuing that thing in our hearts that we were meant to do. And I love the idea that my descendants will have a piece of me in the form of my writing long after I am gone, in a way that they never will through what I do to make a living. They will know something of my character, values, and sense of humor because of the products of my work.

So get off the coach and get to work!
