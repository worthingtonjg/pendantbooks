## FAQ

**Q: How do I submit an unpublished manuscript to Pendant?**

**Q: What is the best way to contact Pendant?**

A: For questions or comments about a product, please email <a href="mailto:support@pendantbooks.com">support@pendantbooks.com</a>. For all other inquiries please email <a href="mailto:info@pendantbooks.com">info@pendantbooks.com</a>.

**Q: I am part of a beta-reading group and wish to leave feedback for a book.**

A: Beta-readers should have recieved an email with a link to the feedback site. If you have not received that email, please check your junk mail or spam folder for an email from Tom Whitefield. If you have checked these folders and are still unable to locate the email or you have deleted it, please add Tom Whitefield and pendantbooks.com to your safe senders list. Then email us at <a href="mailto:support@pendantbooks.com">support@pendantbooks.com</a>.

**Q: Has _The Knights Dawning_ been re-edited since its original release?**

A: Yes. Please see James Batchelor's blog post regarding this here.

**Q: Why is The Knights Dawning only available on the Nook and other electronic formats during "Select Periods?"**

A: Amazon is the largest seller of electronic books. The Knights Dawning sells more e-books through them than all other markets combined. Unfortunately, Amazon only allows books to be part of their Amazon Prime program (the program that allows books to be offered on promotion or borrowed by Amazon Prime members) if the books are exclusive to Amazon. As a result, it is necessary to remove the books from other markets during these periods in order to take advantage of these promotional opportunities. We recognize that this can be frustrating for owners of other devices and regret any inconvenience it may cause.
