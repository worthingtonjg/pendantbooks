title:  Answers to Commonly Asked Questions
---

When people learn that I am a writer a number of questions usually follow. "What kind of books do you write?" is usually the first. But when they grow more comfortable, questions about my books specifically usually turn to questions about writing or publishing in general, as most people seem to have contemplated writing a book at one time or another. Below I've endeavored to answer a few of the most common questions.

**<a name="q1">Q:What advice do you have for a writer just starting out?</a>**

A: This is a bit of a broad question as it might pertain to many aspects of writing, publishing, and/or marketing. But I've found that for most people, the heart of this question is usually this: "I'm trying to/want to/in the process of writing the first draft of my first book, but I'm having a hard time finishing it. What can I do about that?"
 
My answer to this is always the same: Push through that first draft and get it done! Until you have finished writing that last page, do not go back and revise anything, do not restart your work because you “think you can do it better,” push through and finish it.
 
There are a million would-be authors out there who will never complete that first draft because they all fall into the same trap: They start out strong, write the sections they are excited about, but then start to lose steam as they are building the nuts and bolts of the story. They eventually get stuck, get frustrated, and decide to start over, thinking that they now have a better approach.
 
I have been in that place many times myself, and I tell you this is a recipe for never finishing a book. What new writers need to understand is that that finished manuscript, even with all its flaws, is worth more to you than a thousand partially written drafts. The reason is because a finished rough draft is now something you can work with. You can revise, re-write and improve it. And even though you think you are doing that in your head when you keep starting over, what you are actually doing is just churning on the parts of the story that interest you, while avoiding the obstacles that you will have to confront if you ever want to turn out a completed work.
 
I should also add that the feeling of finishing a complete draft is phenomenal. Even though you know perfectly well that it needs some major revisions, getting to the end and writing "The End" is an amazing feeling the few will ever realize. It is a lot like finishing a marathon. A relatively small portion of the population will ever put in the work to actually run a marathon. So, it's a great accomplishment when you do. Just finishing the marathon of course does not make you an elite runner. But no elite runner ever won a marathon who did not finish it.


**<a name="q2">Q:How many pages should my book be?</a>**

A: This is a common question for first-time writers, because you don't have any concept of what length of work constitutes a book. There is always that fear that you will write a story that you are very happy with, but then find out it is way too short for a book.
 
Before my first book was published, I too worried over this question. I would search the internet and generally find snooty, useless answers that amounted to something like this "real writers don't pay attention to pages because it will be different with every printing depending on the typesetting and size of the book." And while I have since learned that is absolutely the case, it was a typical case of "writers" trying to create a walled garden around their field, so they could feel superior to those trying to learn the ropes. 
 
I say that because every single one of those "writers" knew exactly what the people were wanting to know, and yet answered in a way that was of absolutely no use to a novice. 
 
So, here's the answer you are looking for: A standard 6" x 9" paperback book with a standard font size and margins will translate to roughly 350 words per page. For example, my 3rd book, The Darkest Knight, was just over 153,000 words. That translated to a 443 page book (I'm subtracting 5 pages for title, verso, and dedication pages). 


**<a name="q3">Q:What's the minimum size my book can be?</a>**

A: Unfortunately there is no easy answer here. Your book might be 30,000 words or it might be 300,000 words. There is no requirement, but you can get some idea of the general size expected for a given genre by looking at other books in the genre in which you are writing. Nobody wants to read a 300,000 word coffee table book like Chicken Soup for the Soul. Conversely, a 30,000 word fantasy book would likely not give you the space required for a fully fleshed out world, characters, and magic system to say nothing of the story itself. 
 
But one word of caution here: if it is your first book, and you are planning on submitting to a traditional publisher, longer works are not your friend (see my previous post, Red Flags for Publishing Houses for more detail)

**<a name="q4">How do I get a book published?</a>**

A: This topic requires a whole post of its own. I endeavored to fit a condensed answer here, but still it ballooned up to over 2000 words, which is beyond the scope of this post. So, for the moment, I’ll leave it here by saying, write something first. As I said above, nobody every one a marathon without finishing it. Harry Potter would not be Harry Potter, if Rowling had never finished that first draft of that first book.
