title:  Keeping My Promise
---
As promised in my previous post from less than seven months ago, I have an update on the projects currently underway.
<!--more-->

**Audiobooks:** If you have not heard, the Audio versions of <a href='{{site.url}}/books/the_knights_dawning.html)'>_The Knights Dawning_</a> and <a href='{{site.url}}/books/the_knights_mourning.html)'>_The Knights Mourning_</a>) are now available on [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Knights-Dawning-Audiobook/B0B788KXB6?ref=web_search_eac_asin_1&qid=VByPhjqNuo&sr=1-1 "Buy from Audible"){:target="_blank"} and [iTunes](https://books.apple.com/us/audiobook/the-knights-dawning-the-crusades-series-book-1-unabridged/id1636570240 "Buy from Apple"){:target="_blank"} . I have had more requests for audio versions of my books than all other requests combined, so I am very happy to be able to make this announcement.

**The audio for book 3, _The Darkest Knight,_** is 15% complete. It should be on sale around Thanksgiving.

**Book 4, The Knights Reborn:** The rough draft is complete. I include that with the warning that The Darkest Knight required _13_ drafts. But before you go writing me angry letters about how your children that were in grade school when you started this series are in college now, let me just say that book 4 has far fewer subplots to tie off and is coming together much more neatly than book 3 did. (You may recall that I originally intended the Crusades _Series_ to be the Crusades _Trilogy_. But when it came time to write it, there was no way I could wrap everything up in any sort of satisfactory way without book 3 being the size of two books). 

I should add (imagine this next part is written in really tiny fine print) that _The Knights Reborn_ currently has two endings. That’s not meant to sound ominous, I just want to be frank about my progress. I have always had in my head two ways that this series might end. As I’m still undecided, I wrote both with the hope that one way would present itself as the obvious selection. Unfortunately, writing them both has made the claim of each ending that much greater. That said, however, one ending did flow smoother than the other, so that may be my answer. We’ll see what happens during this next re-write.

**Hall of Mages:** You may remember from my earlier blog entry entitled <a href='{{site.url}}/posts/2014-8-3-recapturing-the-magic.html)'>"Recapturing the Magic"</a>, that I completed the rough draft of _Hall of Mages_ some years ago but was not thrilled with the product. Recently, I made some significant revisions to the outline and changed my approach to the story which breathed new life into this work. 

I may have more on this later, but I’m already over my word-budget for this post, so that will have to wait. 

Happy Reading!
