title:  Red Flags for Big Publishing Houses
---
<p>The world of Publishing has changed dramatically over the last decade. There is no doubt about it. We live in a time when anyone, regardless of subject matter or talent, can publish their work to the world with the investment of nothing more than time. And though there are often many reasons&#8211;and even benefits&#8211;to going the self-published route, let&#8217;s face it, the big publishing houses still lend credibility to any novel, especially a new novel from a relatively unknown author. Though the big houses may not be as important as they once were, a reader knows that any book that comes from a publishing house has been professionally edited, proofread, and reviewed by any number of industry professionals. And while it may be argued that this can have a watering-down effect as publishers try to force novels into rigidly formulaic parameters divided along demographic lines, the level of investment and professionalism that comes from the big boys is something that self-published authors very often do not have the resources or understanding to give to his or her own work. </p>
<p>This is important information for writers. Even if you are not interested in soliciting the big houses, this is a fiercely competitive industry with literally millions of other books vying for a reader&#8217;s time and money. It is important to know what will help your novel rise with the cream, and what will sink it into the sludge of the hundreds of thousands of self-published novels which never sell more than a few copies. With that in mind, I offer the following red flags that will count against your manuscript the moment it hits the acquisition editor&#8217;s desk. These are tips from Brandon Sanderson himself on what the big houses do not want to see in a manuscript.</p>
<p><strong>1. Series.</strong> Publishers are not buying series right now. What they are looking for is satisfying, self-contained novels with series potential. I was with Brandon at Comic Con this past summer, and he put it like this (I&#8217;m paraphrasing here): It requires so much of a reader to learn a new world, new characters, and new magic systems, that if a book is successful, the publisher wants to capitalize on the work the reader already did in the first book with additional books, but, by the same token, the publishing houses are not willing to commit to a series of books from an unknown author which may never do anything.</p>
<p><strong>2. Length.</strong> Publishers don&#8217;t want to see anything over 150,000 words, but often much shorter is better. Shorter books are cheaper to edit, cheaper to print, can get to market much faster, and take up less space on a retail shelf, so more of them can be fit in a given space, thereby potentially making more money for both the publisher, and the store.</p>
<p>Another factor of book length is psychological. Editors and agents are no different than you or me as a reader. If they have two manuscripts sitting in front of them from two unknown authors, one is short and one is long, they are naturally going to gravitate toward the short one first. It is less of a gamble to invest their time in a shorter book. As Brandon put it, &#8220;if you can tell the same story in 80,000 words as you do in 140,000, then do it.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>3. Switching points of view too fast or too frequently.</strong> This is jarring for a reader. As one beta reader put it in a review, &#8220;each time it changes perspective, it is like putting on the brakes for just a minute until I come up to speed with the new scene.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, however, let me share with you a contradictory story from my own experience which made a big impression on me. Years ago, I was traveling across the country for the umpteenth time. I went to the library to find some audiobooks for the trip and ended up with, among other things, a Margaret Truman book. I knew nothing about Ms. Truman except that she has a million books out and was the daughter of former President, Harry S. Truman.</p>
<p>The tracks on the Truman CD&#8217;s were very short, only two or three minutes each. This is significant because when I began listening, I did not realize my CD player was set to skip tracks randomly rather than playing them in order. As I listened the book began to skip around and show me a piece of a scene here, and a hint of a conspiracy there. Since I was not familiar with this author, I did not realize this was not normal and I listened for about 15 mins this way, captivated. I then realized that something was not right, but here is the point: I was engaged in the experience. I was titillated by the hints of all the different plots and subplots it was giving me. I was far more engrossed in the book for those fifteen minutes than I ever was for the rest of the book, which turned out to be a fairly bland murder mystery with a bunch of characters I did not care about.</p>
<p>So for me, the rapid changing of perspective was not a negative, but I do agree with the publishers that this demands more of a reader, and a new author may not have the credibility with the readers to earn that sort of effort.</p>
<p><strong>4. Cliffhanger endings.</strong> It makes sense that a publisher would not want a book with a cliffhanger ending when they are not interested in purchasing series, but cliffhanger endings can also be frustrating for a reader who then has to wait a year or two for the next book to come out. </p>
<p>On that note, I cannot tell you how many people have told me over the years that they do not begin a series if it is not already complete. In truth, I tend to fall into this camp as well, so I definitely understand the sentiment.</p>
<p>Now, fans of my books will notice that I violate most of the above items, which brings us to the last and most important principle: </p>
<p><strong>5. Be true to your work.</strong> If you can incorporate the above items without compromising the integrity of the work, it probably makes sense to do so, but if you can&#8217;t, so be it. It is what it is. It is far better to put out a book or submit a manuscript that you truly believe in, rather than one you feel has been compromised. You are the one who has to live with that work. You are the one who has to speak about, talk to fans about it at conventions, and endure potentially scathing reviews from a multitude of unknown people because of it. It can be a brutal, exhausting process. Make sure your book is worth it!</p>

			     <p>As I announced some months ago via twitter and facebook, I have finished the rough draft of <i>Hall of Mages.</i> Now some of you are starting to notice that you have not heard any updates since then. That is mostly because there are no updates, but let me explain why: </p>
<p>When <i>Hall of Mages</i> fell into my lap (if you are unfamiliar with how that came to be you can read about it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190527115631/http://www.pendantbooks.com/jared_batchelor/" target="_blank">here</a>), the rough draft which I received was not complete and needed a lot of work, but Jared, my brother and the original author of <i>Hall</i>, was very good at capturing the magic of the world which is what makes fantasy so much fun to read. He had a vivid imagination and it came through in his work. </p>
<p>So, I took what he had begun and added back stories to characters, a more thorough history of the world and magic system, and I increased the scope of the drama exponentially, but the rough draft that came out the other side had lost a lot of that magic. The wonder and excitement was gone, and I could not figure out why.</p>
<p>In an effort to recapture what I had lost, I went back and reread some of the fantasy that had so enthralled me in my youth, hoping to get some sense of what that missing element was in my draft. I reread <i>Pawn of Prophecy</i> by David Eddings, <i>The Chronicles of Amber</i> by Roger Zelazny, <i>A Spell for Chameleon</i> by Piers Anthony, <i>Dragons of Autumn Twilight</i> by Weis and Hickman, and I even read <i>Mistborn</i> by Brandon Sanderson (While Mistborn is not a classic from my youth, it is a very well regarded fantasy novel of one of my contemporaries.)</p>
<p>Out of this diverse group, as you might imagine, I identified few common threads. Each was very different in its own right, and many of them did not follow the generally accepted &#8220;rules&#8221; of fantasy and magic systems, and that was the major clue about what it was that made them fun to read (although, admittedly, some of these magical books of my youth had not aged well, but that&#8217;s not the point). There are no hard and fast rules to what makes a book enjoyable to read, with this one exception. It was a lesson I learned years ago while teaching, and it goes like this: If you are bored and/or uninspired by your lesson, your students will be as well. </p>
<p>That was the key, and it was so simple. What made those other books fun to read is that their authors had fun writing them. That was what was missing from my draft of Hall of Mages. While it is a labor of love, and something I truly want to do, it has been a labor. I did everything technically correct, added everything I thought should be there, but I never got down in it enough to just enjoy the journey. I was never immersed in the world enough to have fun walking and exploring with the characters, and that is where my draft fell down.</p>
<p>It has only been in the last few days that I have really honed in on this fact, and regrettably, I am seriously pushing my deadline for <i>The Knights Reborn</i>, so it will be some time before I can bring this to bear on <i>Hall.</i> However, it has already helped make <i>The Knights Reborn</i> a better book. Working under a deadline, does have a way of wringing the fun out of a project, but this helped remind me of what was important.</p>

			     <p>I am posting today as a participant in an author&#8217;s blog-hop, wherein a bunch of different authors answer four of the most commonly asked questions that we authors hear. My thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190527115631/http://davidjohnbutler.com/" target="_blank">Dave Butler</a> for involving me in this. Dave writes speculative fiction. I just read one of Dave&#8217;s books, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190527115631/http://www.amazon.com/Crecheling-Buza-System-D-J-Butler-ebook/dp/B00GEGB80U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403319278&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=crecheling" target="_blank">Crecheling,</a> this last weekend and had a hard time putting it down, so take a look, or find out more about Dave on his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190527115631/http://davidjohnbutler.com/dave-butler-writes/" target="_blank">blog here,</a> or on twitter @davidjohnbutler.  Now, onto the bloghop&#8217;s standard introductory paragraph:</p>
<p>We writers share these things informally during workshops and at conferences, but not so much through our open-forum blogs. With the hashtag #MyWritingProcess, you can learn how writers all over the world answer the same four questions:</p>
<p>Q: What am I working on?<br/>
A: Currently, I have two projects in the works: The first is the third book in my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190527115631/http://pendantbooks.com/shop/" target="_blank">Crusades trilogy.</a> It is entitled <i>The Knights Reborn</i> and takes place in 13th century England against the backdrop of the Crusades, the Magna Carta, and the Baron&#8217;s war. It centers around a once nearly invincible family of English Knights, The Dawnings, who through their desire for power, and to further their own individual agendas, have managed to sow the seeds of their own destruction on every side. In this third book, their enemies are all combining to wipe them out once and for all, and each brother must choose between his own selfish desires or the safety of the realm.</p>
<p>The other book I am working on is a fantasy book called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190527115631/http://pendantbooks.com/shop/hall_of_mages/" target="_blank"><i>Hall of Mages.</i></a> My brother wrote the rough draft of this book before he passed away, and I have been working to bring it out for the last couple of years. It is a completely unique world with totally original races and an entirely new magic system. It&#8217;s going to be fantastic. </p>
<p>Q: How does my work differ from others of its genre?<br/>
A: In the case of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190527115631/http://pendantbooks.com/shop/" target="_blank">Crusades Series,</a> I don&#8217;t really know of anyone else writing in the genre, except maybe Steven Pressfield. Pressfield refers to his books as historical war epics. Like many of Pressfield&#8217;s books, My Crusades Series is also set against a historical backdrop and many of the characters, battles, and events in the story are real, but I never wanted that in any way to interrupt the flow of the story or the adventure. I wanted the reader to be able to enjoy the story for its own merits, and, if they were interested, to be able to use the cues in the book to look into that period in history further.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190527115631/http://pendantbooks.com/shop/hall_of_mages/" target="_blank"><i>Hall of Mages,</i></a> I already mentioned the unique world, races, and magic system, but I think the other way it differs is that the story is not the traditional main character searching for some object or thing to fullfill a quest. Like the setting, the story too is very unique and I think readers are going to appreciate that aspect of it.</p>
<p>Q: Why do I write what I do?<br/>
A: Because I can&#8217;t write anything else. I know that does not sound like much of an answer, but it is the truth. Take my first book, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190527115631/http://pendantbooks.com/shop/the_knights_dawning/" target="_blank"><i>The Knights Dawning,</i></a> for instance. I have known all my life that I wanted to be a writer, but I never really had a story that I was passionate enough about to spend the thousands of hours it takes to write and revise a book to get it ready for public consumption. Still I wrote, however, because writing is my outlet. It is my therapy. This became particularly important after my brother&#8217;s death at the end of 2008.</p>
<p>I was struggling to deal with all the emotions surrounding that unfortunate event, so, naturally, I was writing. I kept experimenting with modern day stories that closely mirrored the circumstances of his passing, but those stories were too raw at the time, and I could not continue with them. Then, finally, it occurred to me that it was not his death that I wanted to write about, but all the choices and circumstances which culminated in his loss. That is a timeless story, a human story of weakness, mistakes, and vice which could be told in any age. </p>
<p>Q: How does my writing process work?<br/>
A: This is a difficult one to answer because I am a discovery writer, not an outliner. For readers who may not know the difference, it is just what it sounds like. An outliner creates detailed outlines of his or her work before he or she begins writing, whereas a discovery writer does not know many of the details or plot twists until he is already writing and they present themselves during the creative process.When I begin, I know the broad outline of the story, and some of the major plot points, but that is pretty much it. I could compare it to walking a staircase in the dark. Perhaps you can see a step or two in front of you, but that is all. You must take each step trusting that the other steps will appear as you go, and, in general, that has been the case. Although when that has not happened, serious writers block occurs, but that&#8217;s a topic for another post.</p>
<p>I would add to this a testimony to the truthfulness of the Pablo Picasso quote, &#8220;inspiration exists, but it has to find us working.&#8221; That is absolutely true. I have writing goals set each day, and I cannot count the number of times I have started the day pulling teeth to get anything even remotely coherent to come out on the page, and ended up shooting way over my word goal because I wanted to get the new ideas down before I stopped.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how interesting any of that was, but you&#8217;ve read it now, so you&#8217;re stuck with it. </p>
<p>On that note, I would like to introduce the authors whom I have asked to carry on the bloghop: </p>
<p>Sarah Seeley writes dark fiction. She is the Author of <i>Blood Oath: An Ork Love Story.</i> Check out Sarah&#8217;s blog at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190527115631/http://www.slithersofthought.com/" target="_blank">slithersofthought.com</a> Sarah also tweets @saraheseeley.</p>
<p>Scott Taylor is the writer of the award winning short film, Wrinkles, and of the upcoming feature film, Edwin.
