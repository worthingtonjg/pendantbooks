title:  November Update
---
As promised, I wanted to give a quick update on the state of my three active projects.

The Darkest Knight audio recording is complete! <!--more--> It is with the beta-listeners now, and should be available pretty close to Thanksgiving, assuming they don’t find any major problems with the audio.

Hall of Mages Rewrite: I have written about 30,000 new words for this. I don’t have any expectation for the size of the final draft, but to give you a sense of proportion, the current version looks to be on target to end up around 175,000. If that’s the case, then 30,000 words would represent about 17% of the total book. 

I only add to that the caveat that a major rewrite like this one is not necessarily a linear progression, as often the last 5% or 10% can be harder than the rest of the book combined. 

The Knights Reborn 1st Revision: I’m about 20% through this revision. Nothing significant to report at this time. Progress is steady.
