The Northern Kingdoms have lived in relative peace since the end of The Exile, a war that was fought between the races. The humans banished the Shaldean and Islanii races to First World, and attempted to hunt the shape-shifting Danshii to extinction.
<!--more-->
But now, many years after the war has ended, a new species has appeared in the south. Dubbed "The Revenant," this mysterious race begins hunting the humans near the border. The Revenant Gate, a great barrier between the North and South, is created to keep them in the desolate Southern lands.

Jeron is a young Fielder training at the Redsun Academy. He discovers that the barrier has been breached, but before he can raise the alarm, he stumbles upon the recently murdered body of a high ranking official. He is discovered standing over the dead body holding the official's mysterious sword. Believed to be responsible for the murder, Jeron flees.

Now, time is of the essence as Jeron struggles to find some way of warning the kingdom of the impending attack from the South. Abandoned by his friends, he is alone save for one very unusual companion.
