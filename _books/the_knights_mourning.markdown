The Dawnings are at war! After narrowly surviving a surprise attack on their own soil, the family is passionately divided over how to use their failing resources to respond to the Braddock army at their gates, the escalating tension with the crown, and an unknown enemy in their midst. The mounting danger to the family and their way of life exposes the deep rifts among the brothers, and drives them even further apart as the struggle for control of Dawning Court rages ever hotter. 
<!--more-->
Building on the momentum of The Knights Dawning, The Knights Mourning watches the Dawnings continue to spin out of control as each brother is forced to confront his demons and, one by one, each must choose between his own self-preservation and that of the family and realm.
