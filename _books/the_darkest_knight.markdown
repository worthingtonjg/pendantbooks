The long awaited to follow up to _The Knights Mourning_ is finally here!

In book two of the Crusades Series, _The Knights Mourning_, The Dawnings were betrayed by one of their own. Ambushed on their own lands, the army was decimated by the combined might of a Saracen-Braddock force.

When it was clear that defeat was inevitable, Richard ordered the remnants of the Dawning chivalry back to fortify Dawning Castle in a last desperate attempt to preserve the barony, while he and William attempted to delay the enemy.

Now, sealed in the castle with only a handful of trained soldiers, those who are left struggle to mount a defense against a superior army and an unseen enemy within the castle working against them at every step.
